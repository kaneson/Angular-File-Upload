# Angular Multiple File Upload
A solution to upload multiple files and images to server with angular as a client. We will be creating a sample Angular project and define a file component and hit REST endpoint to upload files. There will be an option either to select files from local PC or drag and drop the file from PC to browser and upload them in one shot.

## Prerequisites

Node.js, npm and Angular 8

``` sh
npm i ng2-file-upload --save
```
